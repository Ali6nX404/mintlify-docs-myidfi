Integrations are modular and optional. You choose which tools to connect, and you can configure each one independently based on your business needs.

## Why Integrate?

Integrations let your AI agent do more than just answer questions; they allow it to take real actions across your existing tools.

Instead of stopping at a response, your agent can:

- Create a support ticket when a user reports an issue.
- Capture lead details when someone shows interest.
- Let customers book meetings, demos, and more.

These actions happen directly inside the conversation, without needing human intervention or switching tools. 

### Available Integrations

Here’s what you can connect today:

- **[Ticket Management](/integrations/ticket_management)** → Allows users to log support issues as tickets.
- **[Lead Generation](/integrations/lead_generation)** → Capture contact details and qualify leads instantly.
- **[Cal.com](/integrations/cal)** → Allow users to book meetings directly inside the chat.
- **[Web Agent](/integrations/web_agent)** → Expand your agent's knowledge by letting it search the web.

And since they’re built into the Botric platform, you don’t need to write any code to set them up. Just connect, configure, and you’re live.

## How to Integrate Tools with Your AI Agent

There are two ways you can integrate external tools into your AI Agent:

### Option 1: During Agent Creation

While creating your AI agent, you’ll see a step called **Integrations**.

  src="../images/integrations/overview/integration_overview.png" 
  alt="Integration overview" 
  className="rounded-xl border-4 border-blue-100 dark:border-blue-300"
/>

- From here, toggle on the tools you want to use.
- Customize settings for each integration (e.g., setting a Cal.com link or defining lead fields).

This helps you launch your agent with everything ready to go.

<Note>You can skip this step if you’re not ready; it’s always available later.</Note>

### Option 2: After Your Agent Is Created

Already created your AI Agent? No problem. You can add or remove integrations at any time.

From the left-hand sidebar in your dashboard, go to **AI Agents → Chat Agents**. You’ll see a list of all the AI agents you’ve created.

  alt="Update Integration" 
  className="rounded-xl border-4 border-blue-100 dark:border-blue-300"
/>

Click “**View Agent**” under the agent you want to connect integrations with. This opens the agent’s settings page, starting with the **Appearance** tab.

<img 
  src="../images/integrations/overview/switch_integration.png" 
  alt="Switch to Integration" 
  className="rounded-xl border-4 border-blue-100 dark:border-blue-300"
/>

Switch to the **Integrations** tab in the top navigation.

<img 
  src="../images/integrations/overview/integration_overview.png" 
  alt="Integration overview" 
  className="rounded-xl border-4 border-blue-100 dark:border-blue-300"
/>

From here, you can:

- Turn individual integrations **ON or OFF**.
- **Configure** tools like Lead Generation, Cal.com, or Ticket Management.
- **Add new integrations** as needed.
- Remove or edit existing ones anytime.

Changes are applied instantly, no redeployment needed. This makes it easy to update your agent as your workflows evolve.
