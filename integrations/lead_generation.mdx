With Lead Generation enabled, your AI agent can smoothly collect valuable information such as a visitor’s name, email, phone number, or a quick message directly within the conversation. There's no need for clunky forms or manual follow-ups.

It’s a simple and seamless way to ensure your agent isn’t just chatting with users, but actually capturing leads you can follow up on.

## How to Enable and Configure Lead Generation

Follow these steps to activate and customize the lead capture process:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Lead Generation Integration">

## Accessing & Managing Captured Leads

All leads captured through your chat agent are stored in the Leads section of your Botric dashboard, accessible from the left sidebar. You can review user details, contacts, and take follow-up actions from there.

Additionally, you’ll receive an email notification each time a new lead is submitted through the form.
