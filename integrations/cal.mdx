### Where to Find Your Cal.com Event URL

1. Log in to your [Cal.com](https://cal.com) dashboard.
2. Go to the **Events** section and select the event you want users to book.
3. Copy the **public event URL** (e.g., https://cal.com/yourname/meeting).
4. Paste this into the myIDFI AI integration input field and click Connect.

## Preview in Chat

Once your Cal.com URL is connected, your AI Agent will automatically detect user intent to schedule a call or meeting.

For example, if a user types:

* “Can I book a demo?”
* “I want to schedule a call”
* “Need to speak with your team”

The agent will respond with a button like **Book a Call**.

When clicked, it opens the Cal.com booking interface right inside the chat.

This creates a smooth and frictionless booking experience for your customers and helps you convert conversations into real meetings effortlessly.

See how users can book a meeting in the demo video below.

## Where the bookings go

All meetings scheduled through the chat agent are visible in your myIDFI AI dashboard under the **Scheduled Calls** section on the left sidebar.

You can track and manage all upcoming bookings from there. Each event is also synced with your connected Cal.com account, so everything stays up to date automatically.
