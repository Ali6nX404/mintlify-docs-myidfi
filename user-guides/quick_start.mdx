## Prerequisites

To get started, just head over to [app.botric.ai](https://app.botric.ai) and sign up for a new account, or log in if you already have one.

<Note> No credit card required to get started. </Note>

Once you're in, you'll land on the **Botric Admin dashboard** where you can explore powerful and helpful features to manage your custom AI support team (yes, your own team of AI agents) and start building your first one.

This is your control center where you can view system-wide metrics, manage your AI agents, access chat logs, and configure settings.

| **Title** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Active Agents** | Number of AI agents currently active in your workspace. |
| **Token Used** | Total tokens consumed across all conversations, useful for tracking usage. |
| **Total Messages** | Number of messages exchanged between users and agents. |
| **Conversation Trends** | A visual graph that shows how conversations are growing over time, along with total conversation volume and resolution percentage. |
| **Conversation Categories** | Breakdown of agent responses by category (e.g., confident answers, support requests). |
| **Visitor Distribution by Country** | This visual chart shows where your users are coming from, giving you geographic insights for audience targeting. |

## Why Data Might Be Empty

If you're seeing messages like “_No conversation data yet_” or “_No country data available_,” don’t worry! This is expected if your agent hasn’t started interacting with users yet. Once conversations begin, data will appear here automatically.

Think of this dashboard as your support control room. The more conversations your AI agent handles, the more this space transforms into a rich data source, perfect for analyzing performance, identifying gaps, and improving customer experience.

Now that you’re familiar with the dashboard, it’s time to bring your first AI Chat Agent to life.
